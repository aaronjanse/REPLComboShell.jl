# Julia + Shell

This is a REPL that runs both shell commands and Julia code. It uses [fish](https://fishshell.com/) for completions of shell commands.

I plan to eventually publish the fish completion system as a separate package.=

**Warning:** This package is inherently an ugly hack, so expect bugs and annoyances
