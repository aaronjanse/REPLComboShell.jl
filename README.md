# Julia + Shell

This is a REPL that runs both shell commands and Julia code. It uses [fish](https://fishshell.com/) for completions of shell commands.

I plan to eventually publish the fish completion system as a separate package.=

**Warning:** This does *not* meet the standards of quality found in the vast majority of Julia packages. This package is inherently an ugly hack, so expect bugs and annoyances. Inherent issues aside, this is my first Julia package, so it very likely goes against besy practices.
